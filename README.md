# ALI Interpretation
Capstone/Software Development project

Create an interpretation and database software in order to provide interpretation services for patients in hospitals that have inadequate interpretation services. 
We want the software to mimic an interpreter to create a natural conversation between patient and medical professional. 
The software should also transcribe and translate the conversations into a database for twenty four hours to keep track of key parts of the conversations between patients and medical professionals. 
The software can help keep track of the conversations, the languages in which the conversations happened, and help doctors accurately record patient information.
