# Syllabus-Management-System
Capstone/Software Development project

Each CS faculty emails his/her syllabi to the CS Administrative Assistant at the beginning of each semester. The Admin Assistant subsequently saves each syllabi on his/her hard drive.

The current system has several drawbacks: students do not have access to the Admin’s computer, and hence do not have the ability to review the course syllabi prior to registering for the course. A student may wish to review the required textbook for the course.

The CS Faculty members do not have access to the Admin’s computer or email, and therefore cannot easily review the contents of an existing course. This poses a challenge for a faculty trying to create a new course. The contents of a new course could easily overlap an existing course.

At the minimum, the SMS should provide the following capabilities:

Allow faculty to submit and review syllabi each semester
Allow students to review syllabi
Allow the CS Administrative Assistant to manage the SMS. The CS Admin should be able to Add, Delete and Modify contents of the SMS
